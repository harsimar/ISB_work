# ISB work
This repository contains all of the visualizations, tutorials, and code written starting from the end of week two of the internship. 

The first two weeks don't have any files because they consisted mainly of googling/learning/altering other repos. Tasks accomplished during the first two weeks listed below:
Week one tasks: learning how to use git and terminal, creating README.files for p7_pilot repo. 
Week two tasks: learning how to use jupyter notebook, teaching myself python via Code Academy and google searches. Reading through pandas documentation.
